# Frontend Test at InvestSky

Hello, my name is Lotfi (لطفي). I appreciate the incredible opportunity provided to me for participating in this front-end test.

Over the past few days, I've worked diligently on developing the app. This has been an enriching learning experience, and I'm looking forward to expanding my knowledge and proficiency in React Native.

In my endeavor to ensure comprehensive coverage of the app, I've incorporated every feature and fine-tuned every detail to the best of my abilities. A mock data set has been used as a fallback due to the limited number of requests available from AlphaVantage. This means that when the request limit is reached, the API call switches over to use the mockData.

## Main Features:

### Market Tab
Upon opening the app, users are automatically directed to the 'Market' tab. Here, stocks are showcased along with their respective data. Users can browse through all the stocks - each of which is clickable. Upon selection, users are navigated to the 'Portfolio' tab.

### Portfolio Tab
This tab provides detailed information about the selected stock. It includes an interactive graph to visually represent the stock's status and additional details about the stock itself. A 'Add to Portfolio' button is available, enabling users to add the current stock to their portfolio. Once a stock is successfully added, a toast notification provides the user with feedback.

### News Tab
The 'News' tab displays the stocks added to the user's portfolio. Additionally, users also have the option to remove any added stocks from their portfolio from this tab.

## Conclusion
I hope my efforts reflect well in my work, and I eagerly anticipate the potential of joining your esteemed organization, InvestSky. I believe that I can add significant value to your team.

Best regards,
Lotfi
